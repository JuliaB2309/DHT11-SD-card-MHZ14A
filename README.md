# DHT11-SD card-MHZ14A
a project including the DHT11 sensor (humidity & temperature), the MH-Z14A sensor (CO2), a SD card (to log the data) and a Memory Card Shield Modul

The sensors measure every four minutes and write the data to the SD card.

The MH-Z14A only outputs correct values if it is calibrated.
